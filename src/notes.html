Game State: The game state will consist of the sequence that the user must remember, and the current index of that sequence that the user is trying to guess. You will also need to keep track of the current round (which also equals the length of the sequence).

Game Progression: At the beginning of each round, a new item is added to the sequence. You can add a new item to the sequence by generating a random number between 0 and 15 (for a 16-tile game) and appending it to the sequence array. You then need to 'display' the sequence to the user by briefly changing the color of the tiles in the sequence in order.

User Input: When a tile is clicked, you need to check if the tile that was clicked corresponds to the current item in the sequence that the user is trying to guess. If it is, then you move to the next item in the sequence. If the user manages to click through the whole sequence correctly, then they progress to the next round. If they click the wrong tile, then the game ends and their score is the round that they reached.

Storing High Scores: As with the Reaction Time game, you will need to store the user's high score. In the case of the Sequence Memory game, the score would be the highest round that the user has reached.
