User Authentication: Even a basic implementation, where a user can sign up, log in, and have their session remembered across page loads, could be a good demonstration of handling user data and state.

Leaderboard Functionality: This could involve keeping track of user's game results and then displaying a list of the top scores. This would show you can handle and manipulate data in a meaningful way, which is a key part of many web applications.

More Games: Adding one or two more games will show that you can implement different types of logic and interactions. Try to choose games that demonstrate different skills - for example, if your first game is more about response time, you might choose a memory game for your second one to show you can manage complex state.

Responsive Design: Ensure that your website looks good and functions well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. This is a key part of modern web development and something that professors often look for.
